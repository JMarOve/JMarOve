### Hiya, I'm JMO 

- All opinions shared here are my own and do not reflect any views from any organizations I am associated with whatsoever.

- I work as a trader and market maker, but before that, I was an algebraic geometer (a lá Grothendieck) who evolved into a quant.

- I´ve been coding since I was 17, mainly in C, C++, C#, Python, and VBA. I'm currently learning Rust. 

- I like to build things and solve problems, so feel free to reach out if you have similar interests or would like to collaborate.
