### Hiya, I'm JMO 

- All opinions shared here are my own and do not reflect any views from any organizations I am associated with whatsoever.

- I work as a trader and market maker, but before that, I was an algebraic geometer (a lÃ¡ Grothendieck).

- IÂ´ve been coding since I was 17, mainly in C, C++, C#, Python, and VBA.

- I like to build things and solve problems, so feel free to reach out if you have similar interests or would like to collaborate.
